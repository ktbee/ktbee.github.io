Steps to process image:

- Amp up saturation
    - this can only be done with color images
    - helps with increasing contrast
    - Colors -> Hue-Saturation -> Saturation 100
- Convert color image to balck and white

    - Image -> Mode -> Grayscale in GIMP
- Increase contrast to only have deep black and white sections
- Use brush tool to clean up small marks, narrow areas that won't hold up well when cut as veneer
