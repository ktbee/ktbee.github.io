title: It's been a good, long while

I will keep this one brief since I'm not a fan of meta posts, ie blogging about blogging, ie "I'm sorry I haven't posted in a while." I thought instead I would share some coding and crafting highlights since the last time I was writing regularily.

### I made a desk

This project was an amazingly long process, but I'm super proud of how it turned out. I learned a ton taking an evening furniture design/build class at MassArt, and I'm grateful for how patient and helpful of all the instructors were! Here are some pics:


Some big things I learned during this project:
- If I don't have a clear conception of how a step needs to happen, it's more complicated than I think it is.
- Mistakes aren't a big deal and are inevitable. You just have to fix them (or fudge it the best you can) and continue on. Eventually you make fewer mistakes and are better ate recovering from them, but the first step is to not stress when they happen. Otherwise you'll never finish!
- How things pieces join together is the hardest part and the most obvious sign whether something is well made or will last.

If it seems like these observations could apply to other projects, that was my intention! I'm finding the more/better I craft, the more/better my non-craft projects go.

### I made a job change
