###<i>Part 3 in [a series](https://blog.katiebroida.com/tag/smart-cities-summit-2016/) on the recent Smart Cities Summit in Boston</i>

As I mentioned in my previous posts on the Smart Cities Summit I attended, I noticed some overarching trends in the talks and comments both from people in the public and private sectors. Based on what I heard and saw, this is my main impression of the near future: cities will start using IoT technology and are able to become a fully wired futuristic sensorscape right now, but issues with implementation will slow this process down (which I think is a good thing).

##The technology is pretty much ready

I didn't realize this was the case, but the technology needed to make cities "smart" is available now. Tech costs are nearing zero according to [IoT consultant, Gordon Feller.](http://cityminded.org/speaker/gordon-feller) The issue isn't so much whether we have the capability, but how we implement it. Feller said the tech is so shiny, we forget that it's the human and system arrangements that need to change. This leads to tech vendors over-promising their product's transformative powers. Likewise [Bob Mudge, a VP at Verizon for Strategic Initiatives](http://www.verizon.com/about/our-company/executive-bios/robert-mudge), warned that to be successful, smart city technology can't just be "cool", but instead needs to show long term improvement. 

The concerns city leaders had echoed these warnings from industry analysts. [Brenna Berman, the CIO for the city of Chicago](https://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/doit/auto_generated/doit_leadership.html), explained that the impact for smart city projects needs to be clear to residents because the technology won't be. A common theme for many city leaders' concerns was the lack of standards in the IoT systems available for cities. It is hard to justify the upfront costs of these systems for cities and they don't want to be locked into proprietary ecosystems that don't interact with each other. Because of the expense and uncertainty involved in these projects, a lot of cities are going for "low hanging fruit" or easier, low cost projects that show a relatively quick return. The most common example of these quick wins that I heard mentioned at the conference was replacing streetlights with LEDs, which according to [Micah Kotch from URBAN-X](https://urban-x.com/team/), is the "gateway drug for cities." 

##The implementation challenges

###public and private sectors are eager for partnerships, but there's a catch

- businesses need to see good roi
    - bob mudge day 1
- govt can't partner within it's same govt as easily
- Panel: looking outward (day 2)
   - Bill, companines aren't quite as focused on making money, also have social responsibility. Win-win for city to get services in exchange for access

###Cities are taking on a role that was previously the federal govt's 

    - New Bedford mayor, "restablishing trust needs to start at local level"
    - Sokwoo Rhee: Fed govt cant fund all the projects or come up with al of the business models

###Biggest question: who own the data? who is liable? How do you store it securely?

- Dr. Reginald Brothers
- USPS
- Everyone is very aware of the recent DDoS attack

###Everyone agrees policy trails the tech capabilities, but there isn't a lot of agreement on what to do about it

- Dr Reginald Brothers
- Verizon on city leaders panel: we are building a plane while flying it. Need to plan regulation for future problems, not just current ones
