###<i>Part 3 in [a series](https://blog.katiebroida.com/tag/smart-cities-summit-2016/) on the recent Smart Cities Summit in Boston</i>

The Smart Cities Summit I started writing about was last December, and somehow time got away from me before I finished the last couple of posts I had planned on it. After 6 months I wondered if I still found the topic (and my notes) interesting. The answer was yes! IoT and Smart Cities don't seem to be going away, so read on to hear my more high-level take on themes I noticed at the summit.

### There is a danger of widening the gap between the haves and have-nots

Technology is getting cheaper and cheaper, but that doesn't mean it's becoming more accessible to everyone. The term ["digital divide"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_divide) describes the gap in adoption between people with means and people without. It has been an issue for a while now, but with the power and potential of the Internet of Things, there is a risk that the divide can grow and solidify even further. 

Lack of internet access is already a concern, and the more we connect our devices to the internet and benefit from it, the further left behind people on the outside will be. The public sector leaders at the Smart Cities Summit seemed well aware of the danger of solidifying current inequalities with limited IoT access for low incomes. During a "City CIO leaders" panel, the Boston Chief Information Officer, [Jascha Franklin-Hodge](https://www.boston.gov/departments/innovation-and-technology/jascha-franklin-hodge), pointed out that [one in five Boston households don't have broadband internet](http://www.governing.com/topics/transportation-infrastructure/gov-most-connected-cities-2013-internet-adoption-report.html) and that children from these households are entering the classroom with a huge deficit. Franklin-Hodge said that we need to recognize that internet connectivity is as basic as a necessity as access to water. Franklin-Hodge also pointed out that lack of internet infrastructure issue can get so dire that some towns in Maine are de-incorporating because they can't attract residents without it. I wasn't able to find a source to back that up, but [it is a concern on Mainers' minds.](http://www.centralmaine.com/2015/05/19/growth-small-towns-limited-by-lack-of-high-speed-internet/)

It seems obvious to me that our focus and money should be spent on making sure everyone is connected to the internet, but I was surprised to find out not everyone feels that way. During a panel with a Verizon VP, Bob Mudge, he said that one of his initiatives was to connect the "heart of the city" to high-speed fiber internet in Boston. He was referring to the mostly low-income neighborhoods of Dorchester, Roxbury and West Roxbury as the heart of the city, but an audience member pushed back and said that the wealthy Back Bay area and its businesses are the _real_ heart of the city and should have been connected to fiber first. This line of thinking will deepen the digital divide and leave people behind in the Internet of Things. I didn't realize that there is opposition to focusing resources to connect low-income neighborhoods, I had optimistically assumed there would just be at-worst indifference. 

The mayor of New Bedford, Jon Mitchell, touched on the need to be inclusive with new technology as well. He said that we needed an ethic of inclusiveness to bridge the not only the digital divide, but also the intertwined issue of the urban and rural divide. With the conference happening soon after that last election, his suggestion that urban leaders need to reach out to its rural surroundings felt especially poignant and critical. He pointed out that re-establishing trust in the government has to start at the local level and that local governments need to evangelize how "cool" smart cities are and its benefits.  

###Privacy will be threatened and, at a minimum, greatly reduced

Another big issue on everyone's minds was how smart cities would affect privacy. Each time this topic came up, the consensus seemed to settle on the prediction that whatever little privacy that private citizens have left will be threatened, if not destroyed altogether. 

- Panel: looking outward (day 2)
    - Sandra: need to build trust bc data privacy is great, but doesn't really exist anymore. Govt will need to be the mediator. 
    - Bill: we should be able to opt out w/o being a computer scientist. Will help with progress. Need to tell people what you're doing
- Harman guy: ppl don't like data collection, so we made it more unobtrusive
- Panel on building safer citizens
   - street lamps can detect movement, sound
   - cameras coming with facial recognition
- Panel: creating safe and secure city
    - singapore's very advanced, but insecure had had a lot of botnet issues
    - vendors don't necessarily tell you, and consumers don't necessarily ask
