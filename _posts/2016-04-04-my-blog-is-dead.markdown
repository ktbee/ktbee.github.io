Lately I've been thinking a lot about how I write my blog and what content I find myself gravitating to online. I've realized that if I were me, I wouldn't be that interested in vacation blog posts and recipe write ups unless I was reading a blog that was solely dedicated to those topics. I like to know what I'm getting when I subscribe, and a jumble of topics isn't that appealing. 

For this reason, I've decided to re-focus my blog on the two topics I'm passionate about, coding and crafting. My loyal readers will notice that my off-topic posts are no longer online. I believe they'll also enjoy the tighter focus of my future posts. I've got some topics in mind for interesting coding problems I've found or ways I've accidentally broken my furniture projects and then fixed them. Stay tuned for some exciting stuff.
